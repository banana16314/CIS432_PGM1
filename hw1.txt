 =========================
 Assignment 4: Multi-Threaded Web Proxy
	In this assignment, you will develop a Web proxy. When your proxy receives an
	HTTP request for an object from a browser, it generates a new HTTP request for
	the same object and sends it to the origin server. When the proxy receives the
	corresponding HTTP response with the object from the origin server, it creates a
	new HTTP response, including the object, and sends it to the client. This proxy
	will be multi-threaded, so that it will be able to handle multiple requests at the
	same time.
	For this assignment, the companion Web site provides the skeleton code for the
	proxy server. Your job is to complete the code, and then test it by having different
	browsers request Web objects via your proxy.

    -no caching
    -just relay the request from the client to the server and straight back.
    -no conditional get because there's no cache
    -proxy the relays request and responses. 
    -any language preferred
    -make a makefile to just run it

    [How to submit]
    CIS 432 students: email  <javid@cs.uoregon.edu>, with the subject "CIS 432: Program 1 Submission".
    CIS 532 students: email <javid@cs.uoregon.edu>, with the subject "CIS 532: Program 1 Submission".

    [What to submit]  You need to submit your source code and a README file describing
                   how to compile and run it on ix.cs.uoregon.edu.  Then your program
                   will be tested on ix.  Make sure you README is easy to follow but
                   not too verbose/tedious.

    Alternative Option:

    You can choose to work on a single class project, instead of working on both program assignments 1 & 2 (Program 2 will be announced later). You then must work on a particular problem, and write a class project report (6 pages at 11 pt font).  This usually means a more challenging workload, with a tradeoff of more fun.  If you are interested, talk or email to me, then we can spell out more details.
    
    -specify port as args?
        
    -you'll manually set browser? (localhost; port whatever is in the readme?)
        -yes
    -any kind of error checking? try/catch errors when attempting to make sockets? 
        -make the barebones version
    -assuming valid http requests? like valid urls?
        -assume all requests are valid
    -assuming http request is port 80? what is the format if it's to a special port?
    -max q and max buffer size?
